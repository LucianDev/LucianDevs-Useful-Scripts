# CONFIGURATION OF THE SERVER

After the initial start of the server, the necessary files for the configuration of the server will be generated, those files include all the .ini files you are able to edit.

To access those files, navigate to:
"...\SCUM Server\SCUM\Saved\Config\WindowsServer"

# AdminUsers.ini
Placing SteamIDs into this folder will give players admin rights, they will be able to execute basic commands.

Accessible arguments:
[SetGodMode] - Gives player access to the "#SetGodMode True/False" command, which enables or disables instant building.
[RestartServer] - Gives player access to the "#RestartServer pretty please" command, which will initiate a shutdown sequence of the server.

Example of adding a user to AdminUsers.ini:
76561199637135087 <- admin commands
76561199637135087[SetGodMode] <- admin commands + setgodmode
76561199637135087[SetGodMode, RestartServer] <- admin commands + setgodmode + restartserver pretty please
